### Airbnb Clone

#### Description
This phase of the Airbnb Clone project involves the HTML and CSS components. Inside the project directory, you will find the "Images" folder containing icons used on the site, such as logos and various room icons (e.g., bathroom, bedroom, guest icons). The "Styles" folder includes CSS files used for styling. In each category (common, footer, header, places), the style file with the highest numerical index is the most pertinent to the final product. Similarly, the highest numbered "index.html" file is the most relevant to the finished product.
